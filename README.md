Hi

I've been a software developer professionally and as a hobby since the mid-80s.

The vast majority of my older hobby projects are lost to the mists of time and I use this to store my recent endeavours. 

Most of what's here is little more than a collection of sandboxes supporting my curiosity as far as I am interested in taking something, but there are some completed and published works in here too.
